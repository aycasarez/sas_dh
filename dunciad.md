<center>All look, all ſigh, and call on Smedley loft;<br>
Smedley in vain reſounds thro' all the coaſt.<br>
Then * eſſay'd ; ſcarce vaniſh'd out of ſight,<br>
He buoys up inſtant, and returns to light:<br>
He bears no token of the ſabler ſtreams,<br>
And mounts far off among the Swans of Thames.<br>
True to the bottom, ſee Concanen creep,<br>
A cold, long-winded, native of the deep:<br>
If perſerverance gain the Diver's prize,<br>
Not everlaſting Blackmore this denies :

    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;VER. 295. *Them * eſſay'd* ;] A Gen-<br/>
tlemen of genis and ſpirit, who was ſe-<br/>
cretly dipt in ſome papers of this kind,<br>
on whom our Poet beſtows a panegyric<br>
inſtead of a ſatyr, as deſerving to be bet-<br>
ter employed than in Party-quarrels and<br>
perſonal invectives.<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;VER 299. *Concanem*] MATTHEW
CONCANEN, an Iriſhman, bred to the
law. Smedley (one of his brethren in
enmity to Swift) in his Metamorphoſis of
Scriblerus, p. 7 accuſes him of " hav-
" ing boaſted of what he had not written,
" but others had reviſed and done for
" him."  He was author of ſeveral dull
and dead ſcurrilities in the Britiſh and
London Journals, and in a paper called
</td>
<td> the Speculatiſt. In a pamphlet, called a<br>
Supplement to the Profund, he dealt very <br>
unfairly with our Poet, not only frequent-<br>
ly inputing to him Mr. Broome's verseſ<br>
(for which he might indeed ſeem in ſome<br>
degree accountable,  having corrected<br>
what that gentleman did) but thoſe of the<br>
duke of Buckingham, and others :  To<br>
this rare piece ſomebody humourouſly<br>
cauſed him to take for his mottom, De<br>
profundis clavami. He was ſince a hi-<br>
red ſcribler in the Daily Courant, where<br>
he poured forth much Billingfgate againſt<br>
the lord Bolingbroke, and others; after<br>
which this man was ſurpriſingly promoted<br>
to adminiſter Juſtice and Law in Ja-<br>
maica. </td> </tr> </table>
