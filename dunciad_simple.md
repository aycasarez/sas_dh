All look, all ſigh, and call on Smedley loft;<br/>
Smedley in vain reſounds thro' all the coaſt.<br/>
295&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then * eſſay'd ; ſcarce vaniſh'd out of ſight,<br/>
He buoys up inſtant, and returns to light:<br/>
He bears no token of the ſabler ſtreams,<br/>
And mounts far off among the Swans of Thames.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True to the bottom, ſee Concanen creep,<br/>
300 &nbsp;A cold, long-winded, native of the deep:<br/>
If perſerverance gain the Diver's prize,<br/>
Not everlaſting Blackmore this denies :<br/>


## REMARKS.

 <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;VER. 295. *Them * eſſay'd* ;] A Gen-<br/>
tlemen of genis and ſpirit, who was ſe-<br/>
cretly dipt in ſome papers of this kind,<br>
on whom our Poet beſtows a panegyric<br>
inſtead of a ſatyr, as deſerving to be bet-<br>
ter employed than in Party-quarrels and<br>
perſonal invectives.<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;VER 299. *Concanem*] MATTHEW <br/>
CONCANEN, an Iriſhman, bred to the<br/>
law. Smedley (one of his brethren in<br/>
enmity to Swift) in his Metamorphoſis of<br/>
Scriblerus, p. 7 accuſes him of " hav-<br/>
" ing boaſted of what he had not written,<br/>
" but others had reviſed and done for<br/>
" him."  He was author of ſeveral dull<br/>
and dead ſcurrilities in the Britiſh and<br/>
London Journals, and in a paper called<br/>
</td>
<td> the Speculatiſt. In a pamphlet, called a<br>
Supplement to the Profund, he dealt very <br>
unfairly with our Poet, not only frequent-<br>
ly inputing to him Mr. Broome's verseſ<br>
(for which he might indeed ſeem in ſome<br>
degree accountable,  having corrected<br>
what that gentleman did) but thoſe of the<br>
duke of Buckingham, and others :  To<br>
this rare piece ſomebody humourouſly<br>
cauſed him to take for his mottom, De<br>
profundis clavami. He was ſince a hi-<br>
red ſcribler in the Daily Courant, where<br>
he poured forth much Billingfgate againſt<br>
the lord Bolingbroke, and others; after<br>
which this man was ſurpriſingly promoted<br>
to adminiſter Juſtice and Law in Ja-<br>
maica. </td> </tr> </table>
